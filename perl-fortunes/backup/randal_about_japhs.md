Well, this ol' JAPH thing started back in 88-ish when I was posting to
a bunch of different newsgroups, and would sign each message somewhat
individualized above the "-- " cut.  For a while, it was stuff like:

        Randal L. "Some Clever Phrase Here" Schwartz

and I'd change the phrase to fit.  I got bored with retyping my name
repeatedly, so I start using:

        Just another <subject> hacker,

in each news group, changing <subject> as appropriate.  When I started
posting to the Perl newsgroup frequently, I just repeatedly typed:

        Just another Perl hacker,

and that got boring, so I stepped it up to Perl code:

        print "Just another Perl hacker,"

but again, that lacked the ability to soak up my then-spare-time, so
I started making them a bit more clever, like:

        print join " ", reverse split ' ', "hacker, Perl another Just"

and that started a trend of me constantly trying to outdo myself in
each posting.  The one that decoded morse code was probably one of my
favorites, as was the "old macdonald" one that is now immortalized in
Jeffrey's "Mastering Regular Expressions" (from O'Reilly).  A few
others got into the act... notably one Mr. Larry Wall who wrote code
to pick a random article of mine out of his news spool, run the code,
but print "Not " in front of it!

I have a little less spare time these days, so the JAPH signoffs have
been pretty plain <sigh>.  But I occasionally sneak something in that
relates to what I'm answering.

So, in answer to your question, feel free to declare yourself a JAPH,
but most of us around here agree that I'm JAPH # 0. :)

print "Just another Perl hacker,"
