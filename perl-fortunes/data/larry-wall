and led designers to believe that if they thought of something cool, it must be considered universally cool.

Look at the use of parentheses in Lisp or the use of white space as syntax in Python.

"The best way to figure out what Perl is used for is to look at the ... 
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (the CPAN, for short). ... 
[Y]ou'll get the impression that Perl has interfaces to almost everything in the world. 
With a little thought, 
you may figure out the reason Perl has interfaces to everything is not so much so Perl itself can talk to everything, 
but so Perl can get everything in the world talking to everything else in the world. 
The combinatorics are staggering.

But you could do extreme programming. In fact, I had a college buddy I did pair programming with. We took a compiler writing class together and studied all that fancy stuff from the dragon book. Then of course the professor announced we would be implementing our own language, called PL/0. After thinking about it a while, we announced that we were going to do our project in BASIC. The professor looked at us like we were insane. Nobody else in the class was using BASIC. And you know what? Nobody else in the class finished their compiler either. We not only finished but added I/O extensions, and called it PL 0.5. That's rapid prototyping.

Interestingly (you will appreciate this as an Italian, or at least

that similar things should look different, because when you don't,
you end up with too little redundancy for effective communication.

No quarrel with that.  But you have to allow a little for the desire to
evangelize when you think you have good news.  Now, it's expected when
you evangelize that some seed will fall on the pathway, some on rocky
ground, some among weeds, and some into good soil.  Sometimes you put
seed into inappropriate places because, as an evangelist, either you
don't have a very discriminating broadcast medium, or you don't know
offhand whether a place is appropriate or not.  Not your responsibility.
