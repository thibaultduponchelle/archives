Jonathan Worthington has requested an extension of **$20,000** for his Raku Performance and Reliability Engineering grant. This will allow him to dedicate another **333 hours** to this work.

His previous work was successfully delivered as reported in the latest reports:

* [May 2020](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/jonathan-2020-05)
* [April 2020](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/jonathan-2020-04)
* [March 2020](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/jonathan-2020-03)
* [February 2020](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/jonathan-2020-02)
* [April-December 2019](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/jonathan-2019-12)

Before we make a decision on this extension we would like to have a period of community consultation that will last for seven days. Please leave feedback in the comments.
