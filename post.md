# Discussing about a brand new perl.org website

I'm not happy with [perl.org](https://www.perl.org/) and I'm not happy to have to criticize, I don't like that.

I'm mainly not happy with 3 things:
- visual aspect 
- outdated and/or questionable content
- SEO

I don't want to be harsh since I know current maintainers are doing their best with their very reduced spare time.
(the usual people doing a thankless job for years!)

But hey, I think we can do better.

The perl.org website is the "entry point" of Perl, that's why according to me it deserves a lot of care.
To well sell the language it has to be 
- catchy
- up to date with smartly selected items (e.g. books, tutorials, external websites)
- look nice (to say "we are vey much alive" and because Perl is also a web language)

To be even more the "entry point", a particular attention has to be put on SEO.

I said in my [To help Perl, just blog](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/to-help-perl-just-blog-9h4) post that Perl is missing good reputation.
The website is one of the most easy and impacting way to improve this!


FORTRAN with the recent [fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/).

Rust rewrote 3 times [its website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in less than 10 years.

Don't look at this other [bad student](https://www.php.net/)

# Content
The informations on the website 

# SEO

# Visual aspect
All is a matter of taste

# Trials
- "quassy" (?) redesigned the [perl.org front page](https://codepen.io/quassy/full/MYGjGm/)
- Mokoto experimented a [GitHub based perl.org](https://makotots.github.io/)

# Conclusion
If you asked me *alone* what would be my technical implementation? 
I would answer you a jekyll/hugo / GitHub hosted / responsive / SEO friendly website.

Before to continue I'm not a web designer, I'm full stack and I wrote and administer some websites (e.g. [tryperl.pl](http://tryperl.pl/)).

I'm not going to sell you my yet another experiment, but maybe convince you that it would be cool to have a brand new perl.org website!
